# ComplexGrapher:
This is a program that graphs complex functions.

# Usage:
Go to this link: https://balam314.github.io/ComplexGrapher/ComplexGrapher.html

# Notes:
CLASSES.js is library code used in all of my projects, most of it is not used here.
You can change the function to be graphed by adding a transformation function.
The Complex class is defined in CLASSES.js.
